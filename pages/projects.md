### Kaggle Dogs vs Cats
Building algorithm on classification of dogs and cats in image data.

It is a Kaggle competition which should also include the submission.csv file for score calculation.

### Event and Location Based Twitter Text Classification
This is the project that I am currently working on. My goal is to analyze the text in Social Media (In this case, Twitter), based on the user's location and classify the event the user is mentioning, to see if there are any relationship with some variables, for example, Location, Time, Events, Level of Interest, Sentiment etc. 

Current phase of this project is in data collection, data wrangling and pre-processing the text data.

### STAT697 Issues in Statistics Project
*Worked from Jan 2020 - Mar 2020*


This project analyze the figures and trends of California K-12 Schools using SAS and SQL. We used the official data set produced by the [California Department of Education](https://www.cde.ca.gov/). It is a team project with 2 people working including me. As the team lead, I was responsible to communicate with my partner and also to the professor of this class. Since this course purely instructed online, we used Google Meet and Slack for Team communication and weekly meetings with professor.

### Lending Club Classification in R
*Feb/Mar 2021*


This competition is a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club), which is part of the project in my STAT 653 course. I used basic neural network to predict the variable *loan_status*, the repayment status of a person. In this project, I compared various Machine Learning Algorithms that is widely used in classification and picked the one with best performance in the sample training and testing dataset for the full testing data set for prediction. The model comparison codes are located under the folder *model_comparison*, separated by each model.

### Titanic Survial Classification in R
*Feb/Mar 2021*


This is also a [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). In this project, I compared various Machine Learning Algorithms that is widely used in classification and picked the one with best performance in the sample training and testing dataset for the full testing data set for prediction. The model comparison is in the report rmd and pdf.

### Data Visualization Dashboard
[FlexDashboard of Lyft BayWheel Data using R Packages](/docs/Problem_03_flexdashboard.html)


## Research Interest
I am interested in studying the difference and sentiment analysis of Cantonese and English Text in social media like FaceBook, Twitter etc. It is part of the technique of Natural Language Processing and I would love to explore their difference.
