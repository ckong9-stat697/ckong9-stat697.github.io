# Research Interest
I am interested in studying the difference and sentiment analysis of Cantonese and English Text in social media like FaceBook, Twitter etc. It is part of the technique of Natural Language Processing and I would love to explore their difference.


# Current and Past Projects:

## Lending Club Classification in R
This competition is a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club), which is part of the project in my STAT 653 course. I used basic neural network to predict the variable *loan_status*, the repayment status of a person.
