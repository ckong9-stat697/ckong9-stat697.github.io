# Research Interest
I am interested in studying the difference and sentiment analysis of Cantonese and English Text in social media like FaceBook, Twitter etc. It is part of the technique of Natural Language Processing and I would love to explore their difference.


# Current and Past Projects:

## Lending Club Classification in R
This competition is a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club), which is part of the project in my STAT 653 course. I used basic neural network to predict the variable *loan_status*, the repayment status of a person. In this project, I compared various Machine Learning Algorithms that is widely used in classification and picked the one with best performance in the sample training and testing dataset for the full testing data set for prediction. The model comparison codes are located under the folder *model_comparison*, separated by each model.

## Titanic Survial Classification in R
This is also a [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). In this project, I compared various Machine Learning Algorithms that is widely used in classification and picked the one with best performance in the sample training and testing dataset for the full testing data set for prediction. The model comparison is in the report rmd and pdf.

## STAT697 Issues in Statistics Project
This project analyze the figures and trends of California K-12 Schools using SAS and SQL. We used the official data set produced by the California Department of Education. [Link to Department of Education](https://www.cde.ca.gov/). It is a team project with 2 people working including me. As the team lead, I was responsible to communicate with my partner and also to the professor of this class. Since this course purely instructed online, we used Google
