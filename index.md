## About me!

### Background
Currently Located in San Francisco Bay Area, California.

Recent master graduate in Statistics with Data Science. Python and R user. Love to explore the world of Data Science in languages and speech data. I believe there are always hints hidden within data and we just need to use the proper tools to extract, refine, and tell the story and help us to make decision that fits most of the people.

Open to new jobs and opportunities, either in-person or remote position. Preferrably working with Pacific Time, but I am also open to work with different timezone.
